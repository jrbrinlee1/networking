OSI model - Open Systems Interconnection
  - Layer 7 : Application Layer
  - Layer 6 : Presentation Layer
  - Layer 5 : Session Layer
  - Layer 4 : Transpot Layer
  - Layer 3 : Network Layer - typically anything that deasl with network protocol (eg IP) and packets
  - Layer 2 : Data Link Layer - typically anything that deals with MAC addresses / frames
  - Layer 1 : Physical Layer
TCP / IP - Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol

UTP - Unshielded twisted pair - common cable sending data - layer 1
NIC - network interface card
  - each one has a unique 48 bit ID
  - technically layer 1 and layer 2 
  - layer 1 because it's the device that send and recieves physical signals over the wire
  - layer 2 because it's operates / communicates at the MAC address / frame level with the OS
  - process: broadcast (address ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff) to switch, get the correct MAC address, send frame, switch routes frame, recieve frame) 
MAC address - media access control address - the 48 bit ID used for NICs - sometimes refered to as a physical address
IEEE - Institue of Electrical and Electronics Engineering - in charge of MAC addresses
PDU - protocol data unit - the smallest unit of data for a given layer in OSI model
frame - the PDU of layer 2 of the OSI model (made up of Recipient's MAC, Sender's MAC, Type, Data, FCS) - typically 1500 bytes but can vary
FCS - frame check sequence - used binary math called cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to veryify the data arrived intact - is 4 bytes long
switch - filter frames by MAC address (i.e. sends frames to only the destination MAC address in the frame)
logical addressing - NIC broadcasting isn't feasible for large networks (eg public internet) instead of physical MAC addressing, in comes logical addressing
subnet - larger networks are split into smaller networks called subnets
network protocol - exists in every operating system - rules for handling incoming data (TPC/IP for example)
packet - the PDU of layer 3 in the OSI model - is contained / wrapped by the frame - it contains (Destination IP address, Source IP address, and Data)
IP - internet protocol - layer 3 of OSI model - it makes sure packets get to where they need to go based on IP addresses (i.e. logical addresses)
router - connects multiple subnets - uses IP addresses to route traffic or packets. A packet can visit many routers before reaching it's desintation. Each router wraps the packet in a new frame.
